## Demo 

**Heroku app:**

https://react-users-sandbox.herokuapp.com/


## Description

It's a Users CRUD app.
There is the users list in the Home.
Possibility to add user, edit user, view detail page.

The data is saved in the store.

The logic of the input fields (update value, validation etc..) is handled by a custom hook. In this way the input component itself is basically just a stateless presentational component.

The style is based on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
